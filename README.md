# MODERN WARFARE WEBPAGE #
## About The Projects
The main focus will be on a _**First-Person Shooter** (FPS)_ called **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** which takes place in realistic modern times. The Aim of this project is to create a website for this FPS game so as to promote the game and also give existing players fun facts or tips they have never heard of. The project will make use of HTML, CSS and a small bit of Javascript.

Firstly, the home page will start of with a visual / background gameplay to show off the small aspects of what the game is like. After that will be a section that describes the game and its features / gamemodes. The aim of all this is to give a visual representation of the game so that it can also attract viewers to also want to play the game. The website will be designed in a way that it matches the mood and theme of the game as well. A slightly modern and realistic feeling but at the same time remaining minimalistic so as to ensure a comfortable viewing experience.

## Commit 1.0
For the first commit/process of the project what I have done is created the navigation bar with proper linking to the other pages. However, the color scheme is yet to be finalized.

#### Summary for commit 1.0:
* All required pages are created and updated properly
* Navigation Bar for all pages has been completed
* Navigation Bar items are linked to the respective pages

## Commit 2.0
For the second commit, I have created the main portion of the home page with the video background and the game logo. Decreased the opacity a slight bit for the background video and gave the logo a border to make it more visible and appealing.

Created the quick access section for the home page where users can click on the image text and be sent to the respective page. Also Lastly, the quick access image/text is linked to its respective pages as well.

#### Summary for commit 2.0:
* Main video background and logo completed
* Quick access section completed
* Quick access is linked respectively
* Adjusted the navigation bar text color

## Commit 3.0
For the third commit, I have finished the footer completely, including extra features such as the developer logos. All icons and buttons are linked respectively. I tried to keep the footer as clean as possible without too many different sized items.

Also, I changed the quick access icons a bit such as a hover overlay and also linked it appropriately to its pages. Similarly, all icons, photos and videos are all placed into their new created respective folders based on the page itself. All folders were named conventionally.

#### Summary for commit 3.0:
* Completed Footer for Home Page
* Added Hover Overlay for Quick Access in Main
* Clean up some code for the previous sections
* Categorised my photos and icons into folders.

## Commit 4.0
For the fourth commit, I have completed the whole features page. I included some extra cool features such as a linear gradient background to make it less dull compared to just being black. I segregated the different features to make it more neat as well and less cluttered.

All the pictures shown are close representations of what the actual gamemodes are based on what I could reference online.

Also, I added a slight touch up to the footer of the home page by also adding a small amount of linear gradient to the background of the container, now it blends better.

#### Summary for commit 4.0:
* Completed Features page
* Touched up home page background (Linear Gradient)
* Feature page segregation

## Commit 5.0
For the fifth commit, I have fully completed the gameplay page adding all the required videos and embedded them into the website. All 4 respective video creators have been credited below under the Media Credits area.

Similar to the other pages I stuck with the linear gradient background to make it uniform throughout the pages and also slightly more appealing.

For the next upcoming commit, I will try to implement a sticky navigation bar if possible as well as improve on the responsiveness of the website. Hopefully 100% responsiveness by the next commit.

#### Summary for commit 5.0:
* Completed Gameplay page
* Linear Gradient Background
* Video embedded into the page
* All video content creators are linked and credited appropriately in README.md
* Added script.js file

## Commit 6.0
For the sixth commit, I had to completely revamp the navigation bar. I learn how to use Javascript from youtube videos as well as w3schools. With that I made my hamburger menu with a responsive navigation bar. I had to remake the navigation bar because with the previous navigation bar it was pretty messy and hard to code out the hamburger menu hence I started fresh but still sticking close to the original idea.

Also with the help of w3schools again and some youtube tutorials, I learnt how to make a good looking button. Though the color will could be refined again in the future.

Now I have more or less started on trying to do responsiveness for the website.

#### Summary for commit 6.0:
* Revamped navigation bar
* Edited the README.md format a slight bit (Features area changed, testing area changed)
* Refined the purchase button
* Learned and used javascript

## Commit 7.0
For the seventh commit, I had to completely restyle my quick access panels as I had difficulty positioning it when doing the responsiveness. The main things that I changed were the position: absolute and position: relative plus a few changes to the way the hover overlay is done.

Also, I have fully completed the resposiveness for Home Page, I tested all possible devices except for the galaxy fold as that device always seems to have an issue regardless of whichever website.

For the hamburger menu, I couldn't really find a way for the view height to adjust automatically based on the page height so I decided to make the drop down smaller with a slight opaqueness to it so that it looks much more natural.

I updated the header and navigation bars accordingly for the features and gameplay page as well. Plus I changed the color of the purchase button and its animation, together with the background linear gradient of the home page. When I played around with this, it somehow gave my image a slight tint of purple which makes it all the more nicer!

#### Summary for commit 7.0:
* Restyled quick access panels
* Updated navigation bar for other pages
* Completed responsiveness for home page
* Refined color scheme of page and button

## Commit 8.0
For the eigth commit, I have completed the responsiveness for the features page. The main difference is that all the features are now in flex-direction: column which makes it more compact and easier to read.

Also I changed the background linear gradient color to the same as the home page so as to match the color scheme. Plus I adjusted the margin spacing between each feature and the border thickness to make it more readible and comfortable for the eyes.

#### Summary for commit 8.0:
* Completed Responsiveness for Features Page
* Added linear background gradient color same as home page
* Adjusted styling for each feature for better viewing experience

## Commit 9.0
For the ninth commit, I have completed the responsiveness for the gameplay page. The main component was adjusting the embedded video frame sizes as well as the header and title font sizes. There was not much required to adjust for responsiveness other than that. I changed the background gradient to the same color scheme of the rest as well.

I decided to remove the credits paragraph as I felt that it was uneccessary

#### Summary for commit 9.0:
* Gameplay page responsiveness done
* Updated background gradient color to the same as other pages
* Updated README.md format a slight bit (header sizes and stuff)

## Commit 10.0
For the tenth commit, I mainly dealt with code validation of my HTML and CSS. I reorganized my files into appropriate folders with conventional file naming. All sources were updated accordingly.

For the code validation, everything has been checked and all errors were corrected accordingly. Lastly, I made a slight transition when users hover over the navigation bar links as well as the purchase button at the footer just to give the website a better aesthetic and flow.

#### Summary for commit 10.0:
* Finished code validation for HTML and CSS
* Refined Navigation bar and purchase button at the footer (Added slight transitions)

## Testing:
### Home Page:
So for the home page testing, the first issue I encountered when making the home page was the stacking of text over a background image but I quickly resolved that by using position relative on the parent container and position absolute on the child container which allowed the child container to move according to the parent parameter.

Next I faced an issue with the purchase button, I couldn't decide how to design the purchase button so I had to leave it for a final touch up near the end of the project. I plan to make a better looking button / navigation text.

I had issues trying to overlay the quick access panels as whenever I tried to add a link to the picture / container the position of the container will just shift and move around. I tried to fix the issue but was unable to, the solution i came up with was by making the text container larger and give it a grey background overlay when hovered over.

Lastly, when testing the responsiveness for this page. The navigation bar was too small, the quick access panels needs to be relocated, and the developer logos were way too big which made the container width a bit messed up. All these were addressed in the responsiveness area respectively. The hamburger menu couldn't cover up the full screen automatically so I had to restrict it to a fixed size but it stilled worked out.
