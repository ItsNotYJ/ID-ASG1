# MODERN WARFARE WEBPAGE #
## About The Projects
The main focus will be on a _**First-Person Shooter** (FPS)_ called **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** which takes place in realistic modern times. The Aim of this project is to create a website for this FPS game so as to promote the game and also give existing players fun facts or tips they have never heard of. The project will make use of HTML, CSS and a small bit of Javascript.

Firstly, the home page will start of with a visual / background gameplay to show off the small aspects of what the game is like. After that will be a section that describes the game and its features / gamemodes. The aim of all this is to give a visual representation of the game so that it can also attract viewers to also want to play the game. The website will be designed in a way that it matches the mood and theme of the game as well. A slightly modern and realistic feeling but at the same time remaining minimalistic so as to ensure a comfortable viewing experience.
