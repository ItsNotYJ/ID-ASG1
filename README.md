# MODERN WARFARE WEBPAGE #
## About The Projects
The main focus will be on a _**First-Person Shooter** (FPS)_ called **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** which takes place in realistic modern times. The Aim of this project is to create a website for this FPS game so as to promote the game and also give existing players fun facts or tips they have never heard of. The project will make use of HTML, CSS and a small bit of Javascript.

Firstly, the home page will start of with a visual / background gameplay to show off the small aspects of what the game is like. After that will be a section that describes the game and its features / gamemodes. The aim of all this is to give a visual representation of the game so that it can also attract viewers to also want to play the game. The website will be designed in a way that it matches the mood and theme of the game as well. A slightly modern and realistic feeling but at the same time remaining minimalistic so as to ensure a comfortable viewing experience.

## Commit 1.0
For the first commit/process of the project what I have done is created the navigation bar with proper linking to the other pages. However, the color scheme is yet to be finalized.

Summary for commit 1.0:
* All required pages are created and updated properly
* Navigation Bar for all pages has been completed
* Navigation Bar items are linked to the respective pages

## Commit 2.0
For the second commit, I have created the main portion of the home page with the video background and the game logo. Decreased the opacity a slight bit for the background video and gave the logo a border to make it more visible and appealing.

Created the quick access section for the home page where users can click on the image text and be sent to the respective page. Also Lastly, the quick access image/text is linked to its respective pages as well.

Summary for commit 2.0:
* Main video background and logo completed
* Quick access section completed
* Quick access is linked respectively
* Adjusted the navigation bar text color

## Commit 3.0
For the third commit, I have finished the footer completely, including extra features such as the developer logos. All icons and buttons are linked respectively. I tried to keep the footer as clean as possible without too many different sized items.

Also, I changed the quick access icons a bit such as a hover overlay and also linked it appropriately to its pages. Similarly, all icons, photos and videos are all placed into their new created respective folders based on the page itself. All folders were named conventionally.

Summary for commit 3.0:
* Completed Footer for Home Page
* Added Hover Overlay for Quick Access in Main
* Clean up some code for the previous sections
* Categorised my photos and icons into folders.

## Commit 4.0
For the fourth commit, I have completed the whole features page. I included some extra cool features such as a linear gradient background to make it less dull compared to just being black. I segregated the different features to make it more neat as well and less cluttered.

All the pictures shown are close representations of what the actual gamemodes are based on what I could reference online.

Also, I added a slight touch up to the footer of the home page by also adding a small amount of linear gradient to the background of the container, now it blends better.

Summary for commit 4.0:
* Completed Features page
* Touched up home page background (Linear Gradient)
* Feature page segregation
